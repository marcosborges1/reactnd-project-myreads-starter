# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 
This is my custom design that serves as an achievement to complete the first course module.


## Information about this project

This project is a simple web page that shows books on three shelves. These books can be changed from shelf to another by user interaction. Still in this project there is a search page that provides books of an API distributed by Udacity, which can be added to the respective shelves on the home page.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## More information

More information can be accessed on the basis of [Udacity's](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) initial base model.
